The development of this project took about 13 hours. The most difficult and time-consuming part was developing the character movement.
Total time spent:
1. Movement - ~8 hours.
3. Everything else - ~5 hours.

For me, this was a new experience, so I spent a lot of time studying different approaches to implementing this feature:
1. Physics-based approach.
2. Using Unreal's built-in Simple Wheeled Vehicle Movement Component.
3. Input-based.
After some research, I realized that the first 2 approaches would take me more time and also had a greater potential for possible bugs, so I chose the 3rd method. However, it's probably the worst for performance and further possible enhancements.

My main goal in this task was to show how I use C++ instruments, so I tried to use different patterns, not only the best for this specific task.

Thank you for the opportunity, it was an engaging and fun experience for me.
